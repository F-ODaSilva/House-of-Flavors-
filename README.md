  * When an Item is added, an alert should tell the user what the current total is.
  * Create a new html page for the cart section which allows the user to see what is in the cart, each item's price, and the totla cost(remember to add VAT!)
  *Create a form which allows for "discount coupons".
  *Create forms to allow a user to select "collection" or "delivery".
  *Create forms for different delivery options.
  *Your total should change based on what delivery option is chosen and whether a discount coupon is applied.
  *Create a "confirm order" button wich alerts the user that their order was succesful and generates the, a reference number (keyword:generate)
